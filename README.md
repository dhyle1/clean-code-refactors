# Clean Code Refactors

Behavior-preserving refactors.
Same behavior, improved readability and structure.

This repository contains small, focused examples showing how working code can be
made easier to understand without changing what it does.

## Scope
- No feature changes
- No logic changes
- Refactoring only (naming, structure, clarity)

## Principles
- Preserve behavior at all times
- Prefer small, safe steps
- Optimize for human readability
- Make intent explicit

Examples will be added over time.
